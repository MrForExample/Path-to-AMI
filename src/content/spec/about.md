# Building AMI (Agile Machine Intelligence) For Truth and Love ⚔️🥀

🧐I started because I realized there are usually hundreds of detailed notes involved for any R&D project of mine just sit in my knowledge database doesn't really doing anything

✍️so, I figured I may as well start to share more of my intermediate thoughts & experiments findings before the final paper and repo on GitHub, this way, even if the project itself didn't amount to anything significant in the end, someone somewhere can still find something I did useful somehow

🍻Not only it can force me to consolidate my thoughts, but also it may help other like-minded fellow researchers in some ways (or just maybe the other way around :), it’s a win-win thing to do so why not?
